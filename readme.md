# Timeline generator - front-end

This is the Angular frontend for my timeline generator app. It relies on an external API, defined in `src/environments/environment.ts`, for data.

This frontend is currently set up to frame out admin functions, and doesn't render any data. Soon it will be set up to perform CRUD operations via the API on the underlying data, but it currently only performs read opterations.
